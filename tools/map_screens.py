Map the dryer's screens to STAT type codes, by walking the panel by hand.

WHY THIS AND NOT DISASSEMBLY

STAT's first field is the SCREEN ID. Control is screen-relative - ADV presses
whatever the current screen offers - so the control surface is exactly "which
screen am I on, and what does it offer". That correspondence can be read
directly off the machine in twenty minutes, with no firmware work and no risk.

Static analysis of this firmware has misled us twice: UNIQUE was called
handler-less and is live, and "no remote control exists" was wrong because the
mechanism was screen-relative rather than per-verb. So the sane division of
labour is: measure what can be measured, and reserve disassembly for the parts
that cannot.

HOW TO USE

  1. Start this. It watches the adapter and prints a line every time the screen
     ID changes.
  2. Walk the dryer's panel by hand - every menu, every option, every screen you
     can reach WITHOUT starting a cycle.
  3. Say out loud (or note) what is on screen as each new type appears.
  4. Ctrl-C. It prints the map.

Nothing is sent to the dryer. This only observes.

# WANTED: button numbers for screens 31 and 43.
#
# Both recipe-configuration screens are identified now, but only Candy's Cancel
# (CLICK 43 18) has been captured. Everything else on them edits values through
# SENDCANDY / SENDCUSTOM rather than button presses, so the remaining question
# is which buttons exist at all - Save, Start, Reset, Cancel.
#
# Screen 44 turned out to be the final-dry screen itself: the dryer sends one
# type-44 frame (and NTFY,44,<seconds>,<mode>,0) when the dry-to-completion
# stage hands over to the timed final dry, then continues as type 6.
