/*
 * The owner's temperature-unit preference for the adapter's own display
 * (boards with a screen): Fahrenheit or Celsius. The web page keeps a
 * per-browser unit of its own (upstream 1.2.1) and mirrors a change into this
 * setting over /api/units so the screen follows; /api/state and MQTT stay in F.
 *
 * The dryer itself always sends degrees F and never reports the unit its own
 * panel is set to (hr_temp.h has the wire evidence), so there is nothing to
 * mirror: this preference is the source of truth, stored in NVS so it
 * survives a reboot, and Fahrenheit until the owner changes it - the numbers
 * then match the dryer's panel out of the box. Stored values stay in F; only
 * presentation converts (hr_temp.h).
 *
 * Never sends anything to the dryer: the setting is the adapter's alone.
