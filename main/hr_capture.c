 * Why unmount at all: without it SPIFFS is never cleanly unmounted, and the

 * disagree: stat() reported 26,359 bytes on a log whose very first read()
 * returned nothing. Since the mount is configured with format_if_mount_failed,
 * a bad enough inconsistency then wipes the partition silently, which is how
 * a 270KB capture became 26KB between two reboots.
 *
 * Why it has to be QUIESCED first: esp_vfs_spiffs_unregister() drops the VFS
 * entry, unmounts, then frees the SPIFFS control block and deletes its lock -
 * and nothing in ESP-IDF stops another task from being inside a read(),
 * stat() or fclose() on that partition at the same moment. The first version
 * of this function waited 3 s for the writer's mutex and then unmounted
 * regardless ("unmounting underneath it"), and the mutex was all it waited
 * for: the download readers, the logbook on the main task and the bare
 * stat() calls behind the size counters never took it. Freeing the filesystem
 * under any of them is a use-after-free in a task that then walks into it -
 * a panic on the reboot path, which the dryer showed as the NEW firmware's
 * first boot reporting reset=panic.
 *
 * So: close the gate so no new file operation starts, take the writer's
 * mutex so an in-flight line finishes, wait for the last reader to leave,
 * write the pending run summary, unmount. The whole wait is bounded by
 * QUIESCE_MS, and if the filesystem is still busy at the deadline it is left
 * MOUNTED: SPIFFS is built to survive losing power with a file open, which
 * is exactly what the reset then looks like to it, whereas freeing it under
 * a user is a crash. The mutex is deliberately never released - after this
 * the module is inert, and a late writer blocking on it is the right outcome.
 *
 * A capture that never mounted, or was already shut down, is a no-op.
