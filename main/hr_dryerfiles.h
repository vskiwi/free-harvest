/*
 * hr_dryerfiles - the dryer's own files (batch CSV logs) in the web panel.
 *
 * ESP-side glue around hr_files (components/hr_protocol): owns the transfer
 * state machine, the side buffer the stream collects FDFILEBLOCK frames in,
 * an 8 KB chunk buffer between the USB RX task and the HTTP handler that is
 * streaming the file to the browser, the last file list, and the on/off
 * switch in NVS.
 *
 * Files are STREAMED, not cached. The first version wrote them to the
 * capture partition: a 1 KB fwrite() on the board's 11.9 MB SPIFFS measured
 * 0.7-10 s, every flash write stalls the whole chip (code runs from flash),
 * the capture writer dropped 160 lines and the trend save failed while a
 * 90 KB file was being written, and the write itself then failed with EIO -
 * the failure mode upstream added /api/storage/format for. The dryer keeps
 * the files; the browser gets the bytes as the blocks arrive.
 *
 * Threads:
 *   USB RX task   hr_dryerfiles_on_frame() / the block sink - copy into the
 *                 chunk buffer, ask for the next block, never flash.
 *   main loop     hr_dryerfiles_tick() - timeouts and the link rule.
 *   httpd         refresh / fetch+chunks / cancel / snapshot - starts a
 *                 transfer and consumes chunks; the dryer is only ever
 *                 spoken to through hr_files' send callback.
 *
 * Safety: every request to the dryer is a read (FDFILES / FILEREAD, both
 * in the SAFE allow-list). They still go out only when the feature is
 * switched on, the link is up, and the dryer is NOT running a batch unless
 * the caller says `force` - ten requests a second on the USB link is not
 * something to do to a running machine without meaning to.
 *
 * Compiled only with CONFIG_HR_BATCH_HISTORY.
