/*
 * MQTT client with Home Assistant auto-discovery.
 *
 * Connects to an external broker (e.g. the Mosquitto add-on in Home Assistant)
 * and:
 *   - publishes HA MQTT-discovery configs so the dryer appears automatically
 *     as a device with sensors (temp, pressure, state, elapsed, prep) and
 *     controls (refresh, beep, batch-name, recipe push);
 *   - publishes telemetry to a state topic on every STAT frame;
 *   - subscribes to a command topic and routes inbound commands through the
 *     tested allow-list (read-only + benign + config; hardware verbs refused).
 *
 * Broker settings are stored in NVS (set via the web setup page), so no
 * re-flashing to point at a different broker.
 *
 * Security model: the device is expected to live on a trusted LAN behind a
 * VPN; MQTT itself is not additionally authenticated by this firmware beyond
 * the broker's own credentials.
