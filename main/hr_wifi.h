/*
 * WiFi provisioning + connection management.
 *
 * Behaviour:
 *   - Credentials are stored in NVS (namespace "hrwifi"), NOT compiled in,
 *     so the network can be changed without re-flashing.
 *   - On boot: if credentials exist, join that network as a station.
 *   - If none exist, or the join fails/drops for too long, start a setup
 *     access point (CONFIG_HR_AP_SSID) plus a captive-portal DNS so any
 *     browser request is redirected to the setup page.
 *   - The HTTP layer (hr_http) calls hr_wifi_set_credentials() when the user
 *     submits the setup form; this stores them and reconnects.
 *   - "Connected" means associated AND holding an IPv4 address. A station
 *     whose DHCP lease lapses stays associated (the driver never reports a
 *     disconnect), so a 2 s watchdog checks the address: after a few
 *     seconds without one the status is HR_WIFI_NO_IP, DHCP is restarted,
 *     and if that does not help the network is left and rejoined, with
 *     back-off (hr_netwatch.h, CONFIG_HR_WIFI_NOIP_*).
