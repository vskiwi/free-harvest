/*
 * hr_temp - the one place temperatures change units.
 *
 * The dryer reports whole degrees FAHRENHEIT in every frame that carries a
 * temperature (STAT field [4], the type-15 extras, the recipe fields), on
 * both the 6.0.641041 and the 6.0.644170 builds, and NOTHING on the wire
 * says which unit the operator has chosen on the panel: CFG is
 * "device-id, model, serial", SNM is the name, UID is identity + build,
 * SYSPREF (which the adapter never asks for) is dry-time settings. So the
 * adapter keeps every temperature it stores in degrees F - telemetry, trend,
 * logbook, capture - and converts ONLY when it presents a number to a human
 * or to Home Assistant. That is what this module is for.
 *
 * A preference of AUTO exists so that, should a firmware ever turn out to
 * report the panel's unit, following it is a one-line change here rather
 * than a new setting. Until then AUTO resolves to the fallback the caller
 * passes (Fahrenheit, what the dryer itself displays by default).
 *
 * Pure C11, no ESP-IDF; tested in test/test_hr_temp.c.
