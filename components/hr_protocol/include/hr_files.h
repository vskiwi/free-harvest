/*
 * hr_files - client for the dryer's file protocol: FDFILES / FILEREAD and the
 * FDFILELIST / FDFILEBLOCK replies. Reads only. Pure C, no ESP-IDF, host
 * testable.
 *
 * Everything below about the wire format is RECONSTRUCTED FROM THE 6.0.641041
 * IMAGE (G0641041.h6r.bin, Renesas RA, base 0x18000) and NOT YET CONFIRMED
 * against a live machine. Confidence is noted per item. See
 * docs/30-batch-history-fdfiles.md.
 *
 * The dryer is the file server, the adapter asks (space-delimited, CR):
 *
 *     FDFILES <pattern> <index>        -> FDFILELIST,<name>,<index>,<size>\r
 *                                         FDFILELIST,NULL,<index>,0\r  past the end
 *     FILEREAD <name> <block>          -> FDFILEBLOCK,<name>,<nbytes>,<block>,<size>,<data...>XX\r
 *
 * FDFILES (executor 0x2b868 -> 0x20eb0 -> directory walk 0x20df8): walks the
 * root of the dryer's internal drive, skips names starting with '.', skips
 * directories, keeps entries whose name CONTAINS <pattern> (strstr), and
 * answers with the <index>-th match. Off the end the name literal is "NULL"
 * (0x84980). One entry per request. [high confidence: matches the upstream
 * author's live capture "FDFILES .dat 0 -> FDFILELIST,HH.37935.dat,0,4341"]
 *
 * FILEREAD (executor 0x2b960 -> 0x20f30): opens <name> (data-flash table of
 * 33 named files first - HRTempFC.txt is one - then the filesystem), reads
 * 0x400 = 1024 bytes at offset <block>*1024 into 0x20006be0, replaces every
 * 0x0D in the data with 0x07 (BEL), sums the bytes mod 256, then sends
 *
 *     "FDFILEBLOCK,%s,%d,%d,%ld," (name, BYTES READ, block, file size)
 *     + the raw bytes (CR -> BEL, LF kept, commas kept)
 *     + "%02X\r"                  (the sum, upper-case hex)
 *
 * A missing file gives "FDFILEBLOCK,,0,0,0,00". The last block is short
 * (bytes read < 1024) or empty. CONFIRMED LIVE 2026-09-17 on 6.0.644170
 * (docs/30): the block frame arrives in PLAINTEXT even on that firmware -
 * only the dryer's formatted frames (STAT, FDFILELIST, ...) are encoded -
 * and the field order is bytes-then-block; the author's live "A1" reply to
 * FILEREAD was this trailer arriving after the data had been shredded by a
 * CR/LF line parser.
 *
 * Because the data carries LF and BEL and can exceed HR_MAX_FRAME, the
 * ordinary line reassembler cannot carry a block: hr_stream_t grows a
 * "big frame" side buffer (hr_stream_set_big) that collects a block frame
 * whole, on both the plaintext and the 6.0.644170 encoded transport.
